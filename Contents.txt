Eventually this will be a list of code I have been meaning to put out there
for a while. For now, it has:

DoScreenDemo
------------
A not up to my standards bit of code that provides a class and a category
that should handle 90% or so of what is needed to make your App work in
Portrait on both a 3.5" and 4" display. It assumes Apps that use view elements
that are either UIView or a subclass (i.e., almost all of them). It is not
meant for graphical apps using GL or similar (though the visual elements that
are not rendered can be updated... as I did with Gluey.)

It should be pretty straightforward to update the code for Landscape.

Enjoy.

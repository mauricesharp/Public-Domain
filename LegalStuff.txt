This is where you would expect to see one of the traditional Public Domain
licenses... well, sorry to disappoint but I have always found those things
to be childish.

So, what is my license... lets be mature about this. Here is code. Use it.
I wrote it and I know it can be better. If you use it, acknowledge it. If you
make it better, let me know. If you share it, give me a shout and link back.

And of course, use at your own risk :-)

Am I going to pursue you with a flock of lawyers if you ignore any of those
requests... sure, lets give lawyers all the money (and yes, I do have friends
that are lawyers and they do have important stuff to do, this is just not
one of those things.)

So here you go, use whatever is here. Be mature about it. And most of all,
enjoy it.
